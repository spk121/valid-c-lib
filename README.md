# valid-c-lib
This project is an alternate set of headers for the GNU C library which only supports procedures and macros in the C standard.

If you place these headers in a directory, and include them first by using the the gcc '-I' option on that directory first, they will override the system-supplied headers.  You must include them first, though.
